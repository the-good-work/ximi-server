## Prerequisites

1. Docker

## Deploying

> n.b. see if step 1 can be replaced by a shell script to scaffold just the config files

1. First, run `docker run --rm -it -v$PWD:/output livekit/generate` to generate the LiveKit config
2. Add the following as a service to the generated `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  build:
    context: .
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
  environment:
    - SERVER_PORT=3000
  volumes:
    - ./:/app
```

3. move these files generated by `livekit/generate` to the root of the project (they are already in `.gitignore`)
   1. docker-compose.yaml
   1. livekit.yaml
   1. redis.conf
   1. caddy.yaml
